            Introducing Bumpers: Safety Guardrails for AI Agents with Lightning-Fast Cerebras Inference
          </h1>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground/90 mb-12">
            As AI agents become more capable—iteratively reasoning, calling APIs, generating code, and producing complex outputs—the need for robust governance and safety measures is paramount. Today, we're excited to introduce Bumpers, a system of safety guardrails designed specifically for AI agents. Bumpers intercepts and validates an agent's decisions at multiple points during its reasoning cycle, ensuring alignment, preventing unwanted behaviors, and delivering secure, reliable outcomes.

          <section id="summary" className="mb-20">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">1. Summary of What We Built</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Bumpers is a validation and monitoring layer that integrates seamlessly with AI agents, such as ReAct-based systems and LangChain agents. It provides:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>Multi-Point Validation:</strong> Intercepts agent reasoning steps at pre-action, post-action, and pre-output stages, verifying both the agent's chosen tools and its generated content.</li>
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>Policy-Driven Enforcement:</strong> Developers define policies in YAML/JSON to specify allowed actions, forbidden content, and semantic alignment constraints. Bumpers reads these policies to configure its validation pipelines.</li>
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>Rich Validator Library:</strong> Includes validators for action whitelisting, content filtering, and semantic drift detection (using embeddings to ensure the agent's responses remain aligned with the initial task).</li>
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>Real-Time Logging & Analytics:</strong> Every validation event is logged. Interventions (like blocking a disallowed action) are recorded for auditing and analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-8">
              In short, Bumpers acts like a "safety net" that continuously monitors and corrects agent behavior, ensuring the agent's outputs remain within specified guardrails.
            </p>

          <section id="how-we-built" className="mb-20">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">2. How We Built It</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Bumpers is composed of modular components designed for extensibility and performance:
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Core Validation Engine (engine.py)</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              A pipeline that runs validators at specified validation points. Each validator implements a <code>validate(context)</code> method and returns a <code>ValidationResult</code>. If validation fails, the engine triggers interventions, such as blocking an action or requesting the agent to try again.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Validators and Policies (parser.py, validators/)</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We define validators like <code>ActionWhitelistValidator</code> and <code>ContentFilterValidator</code>. For example:
            </p>
            
            <CodeDisplay />

            <p className="mb-4">
              Policies (in YAML) map these validators to validation points, enabling quick configuration changes without code rewrites.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Logging and Analysis (file_logger.py, analyzer.py)</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Every validation event is logged as structured JSONL. Tools like the <code>BumpersAnalyzer</code> compute statistics on failed validations and interventions, helping developers refine their policies over time.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Agent Integration (react.py)</h3>
            <p className="mb-8">
              Bumpers hooks into an agent's query loop. Before the agent executes a selected action, we run <code>validation_engine.validate(ValidationPoint.PRE_ACTION, ...)</code>. If the action fails validation, we block it and prompt the agent for an alternative step. Similar checks occur before producing outputs.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="cerebras" className="mb-20">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">3. Leveraging Cerebras' Fast Inference</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Integrating with Cerebras' inference engine supercharges Bumpers' real-time validations. Traditionally, injecting additional validation layers into an agent's loop could introduce latency. By offloading semantic checks and LLM-based reasoning validations to Cerebras' hardware-accelerated inference endpoint, we achieve:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>Instantaneous Embedding Checks:</strong> The semantic drift validator uses embeddings to ensure the agent's answer doesn't stray from the user's original goal. With Cerebras' fast inference, generating embeddings and calculating similarity scores is near-instant.</li>
              <li className="mb-2"><strong>On-the-Fly Policy Enforcement:</strong> As soon as an action is proposed, Cerebras-backed LLM calls can classify or refine the response within milliseconds, preserving responsiveness even in complex multi-turn dialogues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-8">
              For example, if Bumpers detects a high risk of semantic drift, it can immediately consult a Cerebras model to re-check the content, all without significantly delaying the agent's flow.
            </p>

          <section id="usage" className="mb-20">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">4. Usage</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Bumpers is designed to fit naturally into your agent’s existing workflow. Below are a few examples demonstrating how to set up and run Bumpers with your AI agent. We’ll use a ReAct-style agent combined with Cerebras-powered inference for lightning-fast validations.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Basic Integration</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Start by configuring a logger, loading a policy file, and registering validators with the <code>CoreValidationEngine</code>. Then wrap your ReAct agent with the <code>GuardedReActAgent</code>:
            </p>

            <BasicUsageDisplay />

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Advanced Usage</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              For more advanced scenarios, you can add semantic drift validators, integrate monitoring conditions to trigger alerts if failure rates spike, and analyze logs to refine your policies. With Bumpers, you can scale from simple action checks to sophisticated multi-step oversight that ensures your agent always stays on track.

          <section id="roadmap" className="mb-20">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">5. Future Roadmap</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our vision is to expand Bumpers into a universal guardrails framework for all manner of agents and deployment scenarios:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Framework Integrations</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We plan to add native support for popular agent frameworks like LangChain, ControlFlow, and future orchestrators.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Enhanced Semantic Oversight</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Beyond just semantic drift, we’ll integrate vision-language models (VLMs) and advanced classifiers. For example, if using multimodal agents (like Google's rumored Mariner agent), Bumpers could ensure image-based reasoning steps remain compliant.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Dynamic Policy Adaptation</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We'll incorporate adaptive policies that learn from historical logs and adjust automatically to changing requirements.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Broader Tooling & Ecosystem</h3>
            <p className="mb-8">
              We plan to build dashboards for real-time visualization of agent behavior, integration with CI/CD pipelines for compliance checks, and possibly a "coach" LLM that suggests policy improvements.
            </p>
