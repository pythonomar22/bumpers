Guardrails for AI Agents - Feature Summary

1. **Validation Engine**
   - Provides hooks for pre-action and pre-output validations.
   - Manages and executes multiple validators at different validation points.

2. **Policy Management**
   - Utilizes YAML-based policy definitions for defining validation rules.
   - Parses policy files and translates them into actionable validator configurations.

3. **Content Filtering**
   - Filters agent outputs for forbidden words and enforces maximum length constraints.
   - Blocks responses that contain sensitive, secret, or inappropriate content.

4. **Action Whitelisting**
   - Restricts agents to execute only approved actions, such as "wikipedia" and "calculate".
   - Prevents unauthorized or potentially harmful actions from being executed.

5. **Semantic Drift Detection**
   - Ensures agent outputs remain aligned with the original goals.
   - Uses embedding models to compute similarity between current outputs and initial prompts, blocking outputs that deviate beyond a set threshold.

6. **Real-time Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Continuously monitors agent behavior and validation events.
   - Defines alert conditions like high failure rates or repeated action interventions.
   - Triggers alerts with customizable handlers when conditions are met.

7. **Logging & Analytics**
   - Logs all validation events, interventions, and agent actions to log files.
   - Provides analytics on validation statistics and intervention summaries, helping to assess agent performance and compliance.

8. **Custom Validators**
   - Supports creation of custom validators by inheriting from the BaseValidator class.
   - Enables developers to implement domain-specific or specialized validation logic.

9. **Alert Handling**
   - Configurable alert handlers respond to triggered conditions.
   - Supports both soft interventions (e.g., guiding back to policies) and hard interventions (e.g., blocking actions).

10. **Integration with ReAct Agents**
    - Seamlessly integrates with ReAct-based AI agents, adding safety and validation layers to their reasoning and action loops.
    - Ensures that AI agents operate within defined safety parameters throughout their lifecycle.

11. **Flexible Monitoring Configuration**
    - Allows adding multiple monitoring conditions with specific thresholds and cooldown periods.
    - Utilizes threaded monitoring to continuously check conditions without interrupting agent operations.

12. **Comprehensive Project Structure**
    - Organized into clear modules for core engine, validators, policy parsing, integrations, logging, monitoring, and analytics.
    - Facilitates easy maintenance, scalability, and extension of functionalities.

This feature set ensures that AI agents are robustly validated, monitored, and guided to operate safely and effectively within their operational boundaries.
